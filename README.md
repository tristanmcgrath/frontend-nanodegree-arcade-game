# Entomophobia
Entomophobia is a remake of the classic memory game _Frogger_. The player must use the arrow keys to move the player to different tiles.

The object of the game is to get the player to the water at the top of the screen while avoiding collisions with the bugs. Making it to the water will increase
your running score count. Running into a bug will reset your score count to 0. See how high a score count you can get!

To play the game, clone the repository to your local machine and then load `index.html` in your browser.

Enjoy!
